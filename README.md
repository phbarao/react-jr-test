# React Jr. Testing

> I've heard about a junior react test that asks to consume data from [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/), list 20 pokemon names per page and create next and page buttons so user can navigate. So i decided to implement that challenge with some extra features, starting by tests.

**Live Demo:** https://pokelisting.netlify.app
